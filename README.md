# Data-Engineering-1-Term-project-1-documentation

## Introduction
For my Term Project 1 assignment, I worked with the UEFA Champions League database, which provides a collection of data tables detailing player statistics from the 2021-22 UCL season.

### Analytical Questions
During this project, I aimed to gain insights into the dataset from three different perspectives. I chose to answer the following questions:

1. What are the differences between the positions? Which positions have better rankings from a statistical perspective?
2. What are the differences between the teams? Which team is more aggressive, and is this strategy more effective or not?
3. Who was the most effective attacking player in the UCL 2021-22 season?

## Data

### Source
I downloaded the raw database from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azminetoushikwasi/ucl-202122-uefa-champions-league).

The downloaded CSV files are stored in a compressed folder: `ucl_database.zip`. This folder contains the following 7 CSV files:

- `attacking.csv`
- `attempts.csv`
- `defending.csv`
- `disciplinary.csv`
- `distribution.csv`
- `goalkeeping.csv`
- `goals.csv`
- `key_stats.csv`
